## Challenge A Compulsory Mission: “Exploration Rover”

The robot is expected to enter a surrounded area (carton barrier) with black and white tiles (symbolizing different kinds of terrains) of size 1.2 m × 1.2 m. From one of the corners, after positioning and its setup, the robot shall go through all the tiles autonomously, i.e. without any human intervention. The start position can be any of the four corners and the robot can be facing any direction. During the visit to the tiles the robot shall report back to the Scratch program which type of terrain was found in each region. A virtual map will be also created, and a character will register how much of the terrain belongs to each kind of terrain.

## Challenge A Bonus Mission: “Going Back”

In the bonus mission your group’s LEGO robot should be programmed to park on the first black region that was encountered in the beginning.  The robot will start the challenge after it has found all zones or it will start from the middle in case not all tiles have been found.  To successfully complete this mission, the robot must be driven backwards, your robot should have all wheels within the first ever black region it visited and stop without going to any other region.


## Challenge B Compulsory Part: “Search and Rescue”

A terrible earthquake has hit the city and caused a large chemical storage unit to rupture, spilling thousands of litres of toxic chemicals in the centre of the city. There is a person trapped on a sinking water tank in the middle of the chemical spill. Rescue crews are having trouble entering the city with the amount of rubble around and rescue from the air has also been ruled out due to the noxious gases rising around the city.

You have been asked to design and program a robot that can autonomously navigate to the scene by following black lines on a white background (see Figure 4a) and rescue the stranded person inside the Water Tank (see Figure 4b) by pushing or dragging the water tank out of the chemical spill (also see Bonus Section below).

## Challenge-B: “Search and Rescue” Bonus Mission 

In normal circumstances, when going to disaster zones, there is need to transport some equipment and materials. The groups have the option to construct a trailer that is attached to the end of your robot (see Figure 6 below from an example of a trailer). The trailer will need to carry an object (load) measuring 9x9x9cm and weighing not more than 150 – 200g (see Figure 6b).

The optional task is accomplished when the vehicle (your robot) and the trailer is in the chemical spill zone. The object (load) will be placed on one end of the chemical spill area (a tile with a green colour). Your robot needs to pick up the object and move towards the destination which is on the other end of the chemical spill area and place it on the elevated platform (5cm tall). As the trailer will need to carry the object, you may want to consider using all three motors and explore different speeds to generate suitable pulling forces.
