## Using Scratch to create an interactive storyline

##### Scenario

You have been tasked with creating an interactive animated storyline (interactive storytelling) of your hobbies and ambitions, where users can take the role of the viewer. The objective of this interactive storytelling task is to successfully narrate your hobbies and ambitions using the Scratch visual programming. The complete implementation of the interactive storyline must have the elements mentioned in the following sections.

##### Storyline

Use your imagination to create a cartoon like 2D interactive storyline of your hobbies and ambitions. The viewer should be able to interact with the storyline. The left-click on the opening credit buttons, namely “my hobbies” and “my ambitions” should allow the user to interact with your storyline. There are two separate plots, each plot should end by displaying the closing credits with the option to either go back to the opening credits or to the remaining plot.

### Implementation

You have been asked to write your own code to implement the interactive storyline using the Scratch visual programming. The resources for the interactive storyline should be created by you. The resources include the sprites, backdrops, music, and user interfaces. However, your implementation must follow the specification detailed below.

The left-click on the “my hobbies” and “my ambitions” button begins the storyline with a background music. The viewer should be able to interact with each plot using the keyboard controls (see Figure 3). Each plot ends by displaying the closing credits. Thus, the background score stops playing and all the characters, backdrops, and HUD elements are hidden under the closing credits.
